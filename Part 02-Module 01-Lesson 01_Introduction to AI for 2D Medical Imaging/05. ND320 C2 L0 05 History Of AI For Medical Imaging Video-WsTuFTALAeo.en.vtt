00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.595
If you think just about classic machine learning,

00:00:02.595 --> 00:00:06.270
we've actually been using AI for medical imaging for quite a while.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.110
It's probably one of the areas of medicine where AI first appeared.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.345
But there have been so many advances lately that bring deep learning to the cutting edge.
Nhưng gần đây đã có rất nhiều tiến bộ giúp đưa việc học sâu lên thành một đỉnh cao.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.460
So let's take a look at some history.
Vì vậy, chúng ta hãy nhìn lại một số lịch sử.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.085
Logistic and statistical pattern recognition was first applied in medicine in the 1960s,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.900
but not for medical imaging.
nhưng không dùng cho hình ảnh y tế.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.880
In fact, in the 1980s,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.345
computers were really becoming more prevalent and they changed our life

00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:34.530
everyday in how a doctor would approach medical imaging problems.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.195
Even more relevant, MRI was not first applied clinically until 1980.

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.620
Many classic machine learning models,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.990
like support vector machines and random forests

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.490
were not even invented until the mid to late '90s,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.805
but they quickly made their way into health care

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:52.735
with some specific use cases for medical imaging.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:57.815
2012 saw the real promise for deep learning in general imaging problems however,

00:00:57.815 --> 00:01:00.655
with the win of deep learning on the ImageNet Challenge.

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:03.140
From there, it only took five years for

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.040
the first deep learning algorithm to be FDA cleared for medical imaging.
thuật toán học sâu đầu tiên được FDA công nhận đối với hình ảnh y tế.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.110
Now in 2020, we bring you the first Udacity course in AI for 2D medical imaging.
